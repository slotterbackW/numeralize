Turn integers &lt; 3999 into roman numerals.

At my interview with Zendesk I was asked to write a function which converted integers <3999 to roman numerals. During the interview I was only able to figure out how to handle cases which didn't involve subtraction (i.e 4 in roman numerals being IV or 5 - 1), however, the program in this repo handles all integers <3999.
